<p>My writings generally describe a place, a path, a journey, a visit, an event, a monument.<br>
Each text has two languages Italian and English, divided into two folders it and en within the folder Testi2014+.<br>
Some stories have been published on blogspot.it: Quartiere Varesina, Zona 8 Tra I quartieri, Barzio, Grignone versante di Pasturo for Italian, Quartiere Varesina (english), Zone 8 between quarters, Barzio (english), Grignone slope of Pasturo for English.</p>

<p>In my little trips, but I like to call them rides, mostly in a day, for a few hours or even just one hour, rarely two or three days I have a lot walked or run. Here and there for the beauty of the place or to a memory I took some pictures. More recently I walked with the intention of photographing.<br>
Places are hills, lakes and mountains of Lombardy, my city with streets and squares, my neighborhood, my zone, the country and the mountains of the holiday.</p>

<p>Years later I published my photos in albums on Google+ Photos, Flickr, Facebook.<br>
Albums are a specific location: a place, a pasture in the mountains, a path from a starting point to a destination point, a refuge, a street or square of town or village, a monument, a station, a bridge, a parking lot. More rarely describe a route between streets or to get to a place of the city.</p>

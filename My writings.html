<p>My writings generally describe a place, a path, a journey, a visit, an event, a monument.<br>
Each text has two languages Italian and English, divided into two folders it and en within the folder Testi2014+.<br>
Some stories have been published on blogspot.it: Quartiere Varesina, Zona 8 Tra I quartieri, Barzio, Grignone versante di Pasturo for Italian, Quartiere Varesina (english), Zone 8 between quarters, Barzio (english), Grignone slope of Pasturo for English.</p>

<p>In my little trips, but I like to call them rides, mostly in a day, for a few hours or even just one hour, rarely two or three days I have walked or run a lot. Here and there for the beauty of the place or to a memory I took some pictures. More recently I walked with the intention of photographing.<br>
Places are hills, lakes and mountains of Lombardy, my city with streets and squares, my neighborhood, my zone, the country and the mountains of the holiday.</p>

<p>Years later I published my photos in albums on Google+ Photos, Flickr, Facebook.<br>
Albums desribe a specific location: a place, a pasture in the mountains, a path from a starting point to a destination point, a refuge, a street or square of town or village, a monument, a station, a bridge, a parking lot. More rarely describe a route between streets or to get to a place of the city.</p>

<p>The texts I wrote were born as the description of my photographs album, the source that prompted me to write to explain them.<br>
The subject was then deepened with internet searches looking information, photographs even among those shared on social networks.<br>
Because my information were correct, to improve my photo albums and make them more complete with missing photographs with adherence to already written text I'm often returned on places repeating paths. In the new journey I saw and sometimes photographed new details that almost always require a modification of the first draft.</p>

<p>The true main reason that led me to write is walking and traveling again, return to the places and things now dear, and arrange what photographed and later wrote considered insufficient.</p>

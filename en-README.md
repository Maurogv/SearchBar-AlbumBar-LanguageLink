This repository contains the javascript libraries which I use in my programs.  
The first I published add content to a text that generally describes a place, a path, a journey, a visit, an event. Texts were created to illustrate photo albums and some were published on blogspot.it.  
My texts are in the folder Testi 2014+.

The added contents are links to social networks, location or tag, or an internet search. The sites are google, facebook, flickr, instagram.  
The scripts create the search bar to social, the link to another language, the bar to my photo album.

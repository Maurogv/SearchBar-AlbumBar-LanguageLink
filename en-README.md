I wrote code in javascript to add content to my [writings](http://maurogv.github.io/SearchBar-AlbumBar-LanguageLink/My writings.html) in the form of link in two bars, two strips of the same color.  
The additional content refers to the title of the text or its minor changes and are of three types.

The first type of additional content is a link to Google Italy for a search on the internet with its search engine, to Google Maps, to social networks, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter by searching the keyword as a location or tag, sometimes both. This content, a part of it, is to the left of the first bar.   
A second type of content is a link to the page I had written in a second language, from Italian into English or vice versa. It is positioned to the right and must be added to an element, as a hint to the first bar.  
A third type of content that enriches the text is a link to my photos albums published on Google+ Photos, Flickr and Facebook, galleries that I built on Flickr that lets you organize the shared photos, my text on Blogger, Tumble. The link to my albums is added to the left of the second bar.

In my page layout I set the first bar at the top and the second bar at the bottom.

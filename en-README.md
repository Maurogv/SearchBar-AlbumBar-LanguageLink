This repository contains some javascript libraries I use in my programs.  
The first libraries I published add content to a text that generally describes a place, a path, a journey, a visit, an event. Some text were published on blogspot.it.  
My stories are in the folder Testi 2014+.

The additional content refers to the title of the text or its minor changes and are of three types.

The first type of additional content is a link to Google Italy for a search on the internet with its search engine and links to social networks, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, by searching the keyword as a location or tag, sometimes both.  
A second type of content is a link to the page I had written in a second language, from Italian into English or vice versa.  
A third type of content that enriches the text is a link to my photos albums published on Google+ Photos, Flickr and Facebook, and galleries that I built on Flickr that lets you organize the shared photos.

In the last ten years I have often photographed, as amateur and because I felt to do it, without artistic purposes or any study on photography.  
The photographs can be divided into four sections.  
The first consists of photographs come from my rides in my neighborhood, in my town, hills, lakes and mountains of Lombardy, some trips or short journey;

My photo albums are indeed the source that encouraged me to write the text wanting to illustrate them. The subject was then deepened with search on intenet, those of the first type, looking for information, photographs among those shared on social networks.  
Because my information were correct and to improve my photo album adding missing photographs I'm often returned on places repeating paths that is the main reason that led me to write, to travel again, remember what has been seen and fix what photographed, making my journey new thing.  

Therefore TestoBars script creates the search bar with the link to Google and socials, the link to another language, the bar to my photos albums and galleries.

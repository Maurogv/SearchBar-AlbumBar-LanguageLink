I wrote code in javascript to add content to my [writings](http://maurogv.github.io/Two-bars-for-my-writing/My writings.html) in two bars, two strips of the same color, one at the top and one at the bottom.

The additional content refers to the title of the text or its minor changes and are of three types.

The first type of additional content is a link to Google Italy for a search on the internet with its search engine and links to social networks, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, by searching the keyword as a location or tag, sometimes both. It is to the left of the first bar.   
A second type of content is a link to the page I had written in a second language, from Italian into English or vice versa. It is positioned to the right and must be added to an element, as a hint to the first bar.  
A third type of content that enriches the text is a link to my photos albums published on Google+ Photos, Flickr and Facebook, and galleries that I built on Flickr that lets you organize the shared photos. It is to the left of the second bar.

This repository contains the javascript libraries I use in my programs.  
The first I published add content to a text that generally describes a place, a path, a journey, a visit, an event. Some were published on blogspot.it.  
My stories are in the folder Testi 2014+.

The additional content refers to the title of the text or its minor changes and are of three types.

The first type is a link to Google Italy for a search on the internet with its search engine and links to social networks, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, by searching the keyword as a location or tag, sometimes both.  
A second type of content is a link to the page in another language from Italian into English or vice versa.  
A third type of content that enriches the text is a link to my photo album published on Google+ Photos, Flickr and Facebook, and galleries that I built on Flickr that lets you organize the photos posted by each user.

My photo albums are indeed the source that encouraged me to write the text wanting to illustrate them. The subject was then deepened with search on intenet, those of the first type, looking for information, photographs and social.
